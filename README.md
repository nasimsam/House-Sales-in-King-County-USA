# Introduction
In this project,  as a Data Analyst I worked at a Real Estate Investment Trust. The Trust would like to start investing in Residential real estate. My  task is to determine the market price of a house given a set of features. I analyzed and predicted housing prices using attributes or features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, number of floors, and so on.
